# Udacity-Project---Generating-new-faces-with-DCGAN
Worked on the celeb dataset cropped to  64x64  to build a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to produce new images. Learnt about the working of GANS and other unsupervised learning mechanisms and the mathematics behind the working of these unsupervised learning mechanisms
